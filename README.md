PowerPC Footprints and Symbols for KiCad

WIP: This will be a library of footprints and symbols for various PowerPC chips, mainly those used in Power Macintosh computers and Nintendo consoles, that I have created.
These will ease the development of potential PowerPC upgrade cards or adapter modules for the Power Macintosh platform.

NOTE: Current uploads have not yet been tested, and are still work in progress.
